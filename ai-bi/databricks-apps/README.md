# Databricks Apps

## Overview
Databricks Apps provide a fully managed, serverless runtime to securely build, deploy, and scale interactive data and AI-powered applications natively on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. This solves the "last-mile challenge" of application deployment by eliminating the need for complex infrastructure setup, container management, or separate security configurations. With Databricks Apps, your applications come directly to your data, allowing teams to focus on building value, not managing infrastructure.

Since launching in public preview, over 2,500 organizations have built more than 20,000 apps, making it one of the fastest-growing products at Databricks.

## Why It Matters
Coding a data or AI application is often just the first step. The real challenge is deploying and managing it in a secure, governed production environment. This "last mile" often involves complex, time-consuming work from DevOps, IT, and security teams. Databricks Apps removes this complexity by providing a managed platform where apps run securely within your existing Databricks workspace, inheriting its identity, governance, and observability. This allows you to:
- **Accelerate Time-to-Value**: Move from concept to a production-ready application in minutes, not months.
- **Democratize Development**: Empower data and AI teams to build and deploy user-facing tools without needing specialized DevOps skills.
- **Ensure Security & Governance**: Build on a platform with out-of-the-box SSO, audit logging, and data permissions enforced by Unity Catalog.

## Key Features
- **Fully Managed & Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage. Databricks handles the servers, scaling, and maintenance.
- **Bring Your Own Framework**: Use any popular Python or JavaScript web framework, including **Streamlit, Gradio, Dash, Plotly, Flask, FastAPI, Node.js, and React**.
- **Unified Governance & Security**: Apps are protected by Databricks authentication. All data access is governed by Unity Catalog, enabling user-level permissions and "on-behalf-of" authentication patterns.
- **Integrated Development**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing SDLC tools, including Git and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Scalability & Observability (Upcoming)**: The roadmap includes support for larger app instances, horizontal autoscaling, and enhanced production monitoring.
