# Databricks One

## Overview
Databricks One is a new, visually redesigned product experience purpose-built for business users. It provides a simple, intuitive, and secure way for everyone in an organization—not just technical practitioners—to get insights from data and AI with the least possible friction. It acts as a single, streamlined entry point for business teams to interact with AI/BI Dashboards, ask questions of AI/BI Genie, and use custom Databricks Apps, all without needing to navigate the traditional, more technical Databricks workspace.

## Why It Matters
Most business users don't have the time or desire to work in a complex technical environment. Databricks One solves this by creating a focused, purpose-built experience that removes clutter and guides users to the insights that matter most to them. It democratizes access to data and AI, empowering teams to make smarter, faster decisions while ensuring that all interactions are secure and governed through Unity Catalog.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Consumer Experience**: One place for business users to access all their data and AI assets. The clean, focused layout minimizes friction and surfaces what's most important.
- **Unified Access to Insights**: Seamlessly view and interact with AI/BI Dashboards, ask questions using AI/BI Genie, and run custom Databricks Apps.
- **Domain-Based Organization**: Content is organized into "Domains"—collections of data, dashboards, and apps grouped by business concept (e.g., "Marketing Analytics," "Q3 Sales Performance").
- **Simple Administration**: Onboard users easily with the new "consumer access" entitlement, which provides access to the simplified workspace experience.
- **Trusted and Secure**: Built on Unity Catalog, Databricks One inherits all enterprise-grade governance, including fine-grained access controls (like row and column-level security), auditing, and lineage.

## How to Get Started
1.  **Enable Consumer Access**: For now, administrators can begin onboarding business users by adding them to a workspace and enabling the "consumer access" entitlement, which is now Generally Available.
2.  **Opt-in to the Beta**: The full, redesigned Databricks One experience will be available as a public beta later in the summer, accessible via the Preview Portal on a per-workspace basis.
