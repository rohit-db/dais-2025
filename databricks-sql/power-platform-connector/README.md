# Power Platform Connector

## Overview
The Power Platform Connector for Databricks enables seamless, real-time access to your lakehouse data directly from Microsoft's low-code/no-code application suite. This integration allows citizen developers and business users to build rich applications, automate workflows, and create custom copilots using Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Copilot Studio, all powered by live, governed data from Databricks.

By bridging the gap between the Power Platform and the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, organizations can empower their teams to create and deploy data-driven applications faster than ever, without compromising on security or governance. All data access is managed through Unity Catalog, ensuring that the right users have access to the right data.
