## Overview
Databricks SQL (DBSQL) is a data warehouse built on lakehouse architecture, operating on cloud storage with formats like Delta Lake and Iceberg, governed by Unity Catalog, and integrated with other Databricks apps and third-party tools. Over half of workloads come from external tools like PowerBI and Tableau.
