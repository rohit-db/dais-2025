# Vector Search

## Overview
Vector Search is a new capability in Databricks that provides a storage-optimized vector store with compute/storage separation. It enables efficient similarity search and retrieval for AI applications, particularly those using embeddings and vector representations.

## Key Features
- **Storage-Optimized**: Efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings
- **Compute/Storage Separation**: Independent scaling of compute and storage resources
- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast similarity search operations
- **Integration with Unity Catalog**: Governed access to vector data
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large-scale vector search workloads

## Why It Matters
- Enables efficient similarity search for AI applications
- Reduces costs through optimized storage and compute separation
- Simplifies the deployment of vector search applications
- Provides enterprise-grade security and governance

## Demo Guide
1. **Setup**
   - Configure vector search workspace
   - Set up storage and compute resources
   - Configure Unity Catalog integration

2. **Key Demo Scenarios**
   - Creating and managing vector indexes
   - Performing similarity searches
   - Scaling compute and storage independently
   - Monitoring performance and costs
