# Mosaic AI Vector Search

## Overview

Mosaic AI Vector Search is the backbone of high-quality retrieval systems and RAG applications on the Databricks platform. It provides a highly scalable and cost-efficient vector database for storing and querying the embedding vectors that power semantic search and generative AI. Vector Search is deeply integrated with the rest of the Databricks platform, simplifying the entire RAG development pipeline from embedding generation to deployment.

The latest generation of Vector Search has been completely re-architected with a groundbreaking disaggregation of compute and storage. This new, storage-optimized architecture allows it to scale to billions of vectors while delivering up to 7x lower costs. This makes it economically feasible for the first time to build sophisticated, high-accuracy RAG applications across your entire enterprise data estate.

## Why It Matters

*   **Build RAG on Your Entire Dataset**: The dramatic cost reduction and scalability make it possible to build RAG applications over all your enterprise data, not just a small subset.
*   **Economically Feasible AI**: Unlocks the ability to build sophisticated semantic search and GenAI applications without prohibitive costs.
*   **Simplified RAG Pipelines**: An integrated vector database eliminates the complexity of managing a separate vector database and data-syncing pipelines.
*   **Improved AI Quality**: A high-quality retrieval system is the foundation of a high-quality RAG agent; Vector Search provides that foundation.

## Key Features

*   **Storage-Optimized Architecture**: A new architecture that separates compute and storage, enabling massive scale at a low cost.
*   **7x Lower Cost**: Breakthrough in efficiency makes it affordable to scale vector search to billions of vectors.
*   **Massive Scalability**: Designed to handle enterprise-scale workloads with billions of vectors.
*   **Foundation for RAG**: Provides the core retrieval component for building high-quality RAG agents and other semantic search systems.
*   **Integrated with Unity Catalog**: All vector indexes are governed by Unity Catalog, providing a single, unified governance model.
