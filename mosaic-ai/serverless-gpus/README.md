# Serverless GPUs

## Overview
Serverless GPUs provide instant access to A10G GPUs for fine-tuning and inference workloads, eliminating the need for complex infrastructure management. This feature enables on-demand GPU access with automatic scaling and cost optimization.

## Key Features
- **Instant Access**: Immediate availability of A10G GPUs
- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on workload demands
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for actual GPU usage
- **No Infrastructure Management**: Fully managed GPU resources
- **Integration with Model Serving**: Seamless deployment of GPU-powered models

## Why It Matters
- Reduces time-to-deployment for GPU workloads
- Eliminates infrastructure management overhead
- Optimizes costs through serverless architecture
- Simplifies GPU access for AI workloads
