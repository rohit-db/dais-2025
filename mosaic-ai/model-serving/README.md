# Model Serving Enhancements

## Overview
Model Serving Enhancements bring high-QPS, lower-latency serving capabilities to Databricks through an in-house inference engine. This feature provides enterprise-grade model serving with improved performance, scalability, and monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features
- **High QPS**: Support for high query-per-second workloads
- **Lower Latency**: Optimized inference engine for faster response times
- **In-House Engine**: Custom-built inference engine for better performance
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance and health monitoring
- **Scalable Architecture**: Automatic scaling based on demand

## Why It Matters
- Enables high-performance model serving at scale
- Reduces inference latency for better user experience
- Provides enterprise-grade reliability and monitoring
- Simplifies production deployment of ML models

## Demo Guide
1. **Setup**
