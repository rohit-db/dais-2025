# AI Functions in SQL

## Overview

AI Functions bring the power of generative AI directly into the hands of data analysts and SQL users, embedding state-of-the-art model intelligence directly into their data pipelines and workflows. This feature allows anyone to use SQL to perform sophisticated AI tasks, such as parsing unstructured documents, analyzing sentiment, and classifying text, without needing to learn complex programming languages or manage separate infrastructure.

With recent enhancements, AI Functions are now significantly faster and more powerful, offering up to 3x the speed and 4x lower cost on large-scale workloads compared to other vendors. The introduction of multi-modal capabilities means you can now seamlessly work across text, images, and other data types, unlocking valuable insights from previously inaccessible enterprise content right within your Databricks SQL environment.
