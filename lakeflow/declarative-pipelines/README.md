# Declarative Pipelines

## Overview
Declarative Pipelines is an open-sourced DLT (Delta Live Tables) framework powered by Spark 4.0. It enables data engineers to define data pipelines using a declarative approach, focusing on what needs to be done rather than how to do it, while leveraging the power of Apache Spark.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Syntax**: Define pipelines using what-to-do rather than how-to-do
- **Spark 4.0 Integration**: Leverages latest Spark capabilities
- **Open Source**: Available as part of the Apache Spark ecosystem
- **Automated Optimization**: Smart optimization of pipeline execution
- **Governance Support**: Integration with Unity Catalog

## Why It Matters
- Simplifies pipeline development and maintenance
- Improves pipeline performance and reliability
- Enables better collaboration between teams
- Reduces operational complexity

## Demo Guide
1. **Setup**
   - Configure Spark 4.0 environment
   - Set up Unity Catalog integration
   - Configure pipeline monitoring

2. **Key Demo Scenarios**
